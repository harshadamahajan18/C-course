// Naming: Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores.

// Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).

// No Reserved Words: Variable names cannot be C reserved keywords (e.g., int, return).

// Length: There is no strict limit on variable name length, but using descriptive names is recommended.

// Initialization: Variables should be initialized before use to avoid unpredictable behavior
